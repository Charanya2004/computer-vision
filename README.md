# sentiment_analysis

I have developed a 𝗦𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀 𝗧𝗼𝗼𝗹 that allows users to extract and analyze reviews from any URL! Using 𝑷𝒚𝒕𝒉𝒐𝒏 and 𝑭𝒍𝒂𝒔𝒌, this web application scrapes review data, performs sentiment analysis using a pre-trained 𝗕𝗘𝗥𝗧 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹, and presents the results in an interactive format.
Key Features:
• User-friendly interface to input any URL and class name for review extraction
• Robust sentiment analysis to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral
• Clean and attractive presentation of results in a well-formatted table
